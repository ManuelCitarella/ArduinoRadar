# Arduino Radar
A simple project made with arduino.
With this project, you can build a radar that identify the objects near the radar and show where are these objects on the screen.
This is made using the Processing language.
Also, this is was my project for the exams of the last school year, and it was really appreciated! Anyway, if you are using for the first time arduino, this project may be useful to you! ;)
